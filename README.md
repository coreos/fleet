fleet is no longer developed or maintained by CoreOS. After February 1, 2018, a fleet container image will continue to be available from the CoreOS Quay registry, but will not be shipped as part of Container Linux. CoreOS instead [recommends Kubernetes for all clustering needs](https://coreos.com/blog/migrating-from-fleet-to-kubernetes.html).

The project exists here for historical reference. If you are interested in the future of the project and taking over stewardship, please contact fleet@coreos.com

# fleet - a distributed init system

[![codebeat](https://codebeat.co/badges/16512202-9758-4e2e-b0b8-4121724680b8)](https://codebeat.co/projects/github-com-coreos-fleet)

fleet ties together [systemd][coreos-systemd] and [etcd][etcd] into a simple distributed init system. Think of it as an extension of systemd that operates at the cluster level instead of the machine level.

**This project is quite low-level, and is designed as a foundation for higher order orchestration.** fleet is a cluster-wide elaboration on systemd units, and is not a container manager or orchestration system. fleet supports basic scheduling of systemd units across nodes in a cluster. Those looking for more complex scheduling requirements or a first-class container orchestration system should check out [Kubernetes][kubernetes]. The [fleet and kubernetes comparison table][fleet-vs-k8s] has more information about the two systems.

## Current status

The fleet project is [no longer maintained](#deprecation-warning).

As of v1.0.0, fleet has seen production use for some time and is largely considered stable.
However, there are [various known and unresolved issues](https://github.com/coreos/fleet/issues), including [scalability limitations][fleet-scaling] with its architecture.
As such, it is not recommended to run fleet clusters larger than 100 nodes or with more than 1000 services.

## Using fleet

Launching a unit with fleet is as simple as running `fleetctl start`:

```sh
$ fleetctl start examples/hello.service
Unit hello.service launched on 113f16a7.../172.17.8.103
```

The `fleetctl start` command waits for the unit to get scheduled and actually start somewhere in the cluster.
`fleetctl list-unit-files` tells you the desired state of your units and where they are currently scheduled:

```sh
$ fleetctl list-unit-files
UNIT            HASH     DSTATE    STATE     TMACHINE
hello.service   e55c0ae  launched  launched  113f16a7.../172.17.8.103
```

`fleetctl list-units` exposes the systemd state for each unit in your fleet cluster:

```sh
$ fleetctl list-units
UNIT            MACHINE                    ACTIVE   SUB
hello.service   113f16a7.../172.17.8.103   active   running
```

## Supported Deployment Patterns

fleet is not intended to be an all-purpose orchestration system, and as such supports only a few simple deployment patterns:

* Deploy a single unit anywhere on the cluster
* Deploy a unit globally everywhere in the cluster
* Automatic rescheduling of units on machine failure
* Ensure that units are deployed together on the same machine
* Forbid specific units from colocation on the same machine (anti-affinity)
* Deploy units to machines only with specific metadata

These patterns are all defined using [custom systemd unit options][unit-files].

## Getting Started

Before you can deploy units, fleet must be [deployed and configured][deploy-and-configure] on each host in your cluster. (If you are running CoreOS, fleet is already installed.)

After you have machines configured (check `fleetctl list-machines`), get to work with the [client][using-the-client.md].

### Building

fleet must be built with Go 1.5+ on a Linux machine. Simply run `./build` and then copy the binaries out of `bin/` directory onto each of your machines. The tests can similarly be run by simply invoking `./test`.

If you're on a machine without Go 1.5+ but you have Docker installed, run `./build-docker` to compile the binaries instead.
