# Using the Client

fleet provides a command-line tool called `fleetctl`. The commands provided by fleetctl are generally identical to those of systemd's CLI, `systemctl`, while enabling a user to interact with an entire cluster of disconnected systemd instances.

## Get up and running

The `fleetctl` binary is included in all CoreOS distributions, so it is as simple as SSH'ing in to your CoreOS machine and executing `fleetctl`.

### Custom etcd Endpoint

fleetctl requires direct communication with the etcd cluster that your fleet machines are configured to use. Use the `--endpoint` flag to override the default of `http://127.0.0.1:4001`:

    fleetctl --endpoint http://<IP:PORT> list-units
    
Alternatively, `--endpoint` can be provided through the `FLEETCTL_ENDPOINT` environment variable:

	FLEETCTL_ENDPOINT=http://<IP:[PORT]> fleetctl list-units

### From an External Host

If you prefer to execute fleetctl from an external host (i.e. your laptop), the `--tunnel` flag can be used to tunnel communication with your fleet cluster over SSH:

    fleetctl --tunnel <IP[:PORT]> list-units

One can also provide `--tunnel` through the environment variable `FLEETCTL_TUNNEL`:

```
FLEETCTL_TUNNEL=<IP[:PORT]>
fleetctl list-units
```

When using `--tunnel` and `--endpoint` together, it is important to note that all etcd requests will be made through the SSH tunnel. The address in the `--endpoint` flag must be routable from the server hosting the tunnel.

Be sure to install one of the [tagged releases](https://github.com/coreos/fleet/releases) of `fleetctl` that matches the version of fleet running on the CoreOS machine. Find the version on the server with:

```
fleet -version
```

See more about [configuring remote access](https://github.com/coreos/fleet/blob/master/Documentation/remote-access.md).

## Interact with units

For information about the additional unit file parameters fleet will interact with, see [this documentation](https://github.com/coreos/fleet/blob/master/Documentation/unit-files.md).

### Explore existing units

List all units in the fleet cluster with `fleetctl list-units`. This will describe all units the fleet cluster knows about, running or not:

```
$ fleetctl list-units
UNIT			LOAD	ACTIVE	SUB		DESC	MACHINE
hello.service	loaded	active	running	-	148a18ff-6e95-4cd8-92da-c9de9bb90d5a
ping.service	-		-		-		-	-
pong.service	-		-		-		-	-
```

### Push units into the cluster

Getting units into the cluster is as simple as a call to `fleetctl submit` with a path to one or more unit files:

```
$ fleetctl submit examples/hello.service
```
You can also rely on your shell's path-expansion to conveniently submit a large set of unit files:

```
$ ls examples/
hello.service	ping.service	pong.service
$ fleetctl submit examples/*
```

Submission of units to a fleet cluster does not cause them to be scheduled out to specific hosts. The unit should be visible in a `fleetctl list-units` command, but have no reported state.

### Remove units from the cluster

A unit can be removed from a cluster with the `destroy` command:

```
$ fleetctl destroy hello.service
```

The `destroy` command does two things:

1. Instruct systemd on the host machine to stop the unit, deferring to systemd completely for any custom stop directives (i.e. ExecStop option in the unit file).
2. Remove the unit file from the cluster, making it impossible to start again until it has been re-submitted.

### View unit contents

The contents of a loaded unit file can be printed to stdout using the `fleetctl cat` command:

```
$ fleetctl cat examples/hello.service
[Unit]
Description=Hello World

[Service]
ExecStart=/bin/bash -c "while true; do echo \"Hello, world\"; sleep 1; done"
```

### Start and stop units

Once a unit has been submitted to the fleet cluster, it can be started and stopped like so:

```
$ fleetctl start hello.service
```

The `start` operation is what causes a unit to be scheduled to a specific host and executed.

Halting execution of a unit is as simple as calling `stop`:

```
$ fleetctl stop hello.service
```

### Query unit status

Once a unit has been started, fleet will publish its status. The systemd state fields 'LoadState', 'ActiveState', and 'SubState' can be retrieved with `fleetctl list-units`. To get all of the unit's state information, the `fleetctl status` command will actually call systemctl on the machine running a given unit over SSH:

```
$ fleetctl status hello.service
hello.service - Hello World
   Loaded: loaded (/run/systemd/system/hello.service; enabled-runtime)
   Active: active (running) since Wed 2014-01-29 23:20:23 UTC; 1h 49min ago
 Main PID: 6973 (bash)
   CGroup: /system.slice/hello.1.service
           ├─ 6973 /bin/bash -c while true; do echo "Hello, world"; sleep 1; done
           └─20381 sleep 1

Jan 30 01:09:18 ip-172-31-5-250 bash[6973]: Hello, world
Jan 30 01:09:19 ip-172-31-5-250 bash[6973]: Hello, world
Jan 30 01:09:20 ip-172-31-5-250 bash[6973]: Hello, world
Jan 30 01:09:21 ip-172-31-5-250 bash[6973]: Hello, world
Jan 30 01:09:22 ip-172-31-5-250 bash[6973]: Hello, world
Jan 30 01:09:23 ip-172-31-5-250 bash[6973]: Hello, world
Jan 30 01:09:24 ip-172-31-5-250 bash[6973]: Hello, world
Jan 30 01:09:25 ip-172-31-5-250 bash[6973]: Hello, world
Jan 30 01:09:26 ip-172-31-5-250 bash[6973]: Hello, world
Jan 30 01:09:27 ip-172-31-5-250 bash[6973]: Hello, world
```

### Fetch unit logs

The `fleetctl journal` command can be used to interact directly with `journalctl` on the machine running a given unit:

```
$ fleetctl journal hello.service
-- Logs begin at Wed 2014-01-29 20:50:48 UTC, end at Thu 2014-01-30 01:14:55 UTC. --
Jan 30 01:14:46 ip-172-31-5-250 bash[6973]: Hello, world
Jan 30 01:14:47 ip-172-31-5-250 bash[6973]: Hello, world
Jan 30 01:14:48 ip-172-31-5-250 bash[6973]: Hello, world
Jan 30 01:14:49 ip-172-31-5-250 bash[6973]: Hello, world
Jan 30 01:14:50 ip-172-31-5-250 bash[6973]: Hello, world
Jan 30 01:14:51 ip-172-31-5-250 bash[6973]: Hello, world
Jan 30 01:14:52 ip-172-31-5-250 bash[6973]: Hello, world
Jan 30 01:14:53 ip-172-31-5-250 bash[6973]: Hello, world
Jan 30 01:14:54 ip-172-31-5-250 bash[6973]: Hello, world
Jan 30 01:14:55 ip-172-31-5-250 bash[6973]: Hello, world
```

## Exploring the cluster

### Enumerate hosts

Describe all of the machines currently connected to the cluster with `fleetctl list-machines`:

```
$ fleetctl list-machines
MACHINE									IP			METADATA
148a18ff-6e95-4cd8-92da-c9de9bb90d5a	19.4.0.112	region=us-west
491586a6-508f-4583-a71d-bfc4d146e996	19.4.0.113	region=us-east
```

### SSH dynamically to host

The `fleetctl ssh` command can be used to open a pseudo-terminal over SSH to a host in the fleet cluster. The command will look up the IP address of a machine based on the provided machine ID:

```
$ fleetctl ssh 491586a6-508f-4583-a71d-bfc4d146e996
   ______                ____  _____
  / ____/___  ________  / __ \/ ___/
 / /   / __ \/ ___/ _ \/ / / /\__ \
/ /___/ /_/ / /  /  __/ /_/ /___/ /
\____/\____/_/   \___/\____//____/
core@ip-172-31-5-251 ~ $
```

Alternatively, a unit name can be provided using the `--unit` flag. `fleetctl ssh --unit <UNIT>` will look up the location of the
provided unit in the cluster before opening an SSH connection:

```
$ fleetctl ssh --unit hello.service
   ______                ____  _____
  / ____/___  ________  / __ \/ ___/
 / /   / __ \/ ___/ _ \/ / / /\__ \
/ /___/ /_/ / /  /  __/ /_/ /___/ /
\____/\____/_/   \___/\____//____/
core@ip-172-31-5-250 ~ $
```

### Known-Hosts Verification

Fingerprints of machines accessed through fleetctl are stored in `$HOME/.fleetctl/known_hosts` and used for the verification of machine identity.
If a machine presents a fingerprint that differs from that found in the known_hosts file, the SSH connection will be aborted.

Disable the storage of fingerprints with `--strict-host-key-checking=false`, or change the location of your fingerprints with the `--known-hosts-file=<LOCATION>` flag.
