	Summary: "Instruct systemd to rolling restart one or more units in the cluster.",
	Usage:   "[--block-attempts=N] UNIT...",
	Description: `Restarts one or more units in the cluster. If they are stopped it starts them.

Instructs systemd on the host machine to stop then start the unit, deferring to systemd
completely for any custom restart directives (i.e. ExecStop options in the unit
file).

For units which are not global, restart operations are performed synchronously,
which means fleetctl will block until it detects that the unit(s) have
transitioned to a stopped state and then back to a started state. This behaviour can be configured with the
respective --block-attempts options. Restart operations on global
units are always non-blocking.

Restart a single unit:
	fleetctl restart foo.service

Restart an entire directory of units with glob matching, without waiting:
	fleetctl restart myservice/*`,
	Run: runRestartUnit,
}
